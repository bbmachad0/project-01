# ─── Bandit SAST Baseline Configuration ──────────────────────────
# Adjust severity/confidence thresholds and per-test skips.
# All suppressions are documented with the rationale.
#
# Docs: https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html

# Scan medium+ severity, medium+ confidence (same thresholds as CI flags).
# This eliminates low-confidence noise while catching real issues.
# Note: the -ll -ii CLI flags take precedence when supplied explicitly.

# Per-test skips: only suppress tests that are provably false positives
# for this codebase.
skips =
    # B608: "Possible SQL injection vector through string-based query construction"
    # All spark.sql() calls in core/iceberg/catalog.py and core/io/writers.py use
    # Iceberg system table names and DataFrame column names as identifiers.
    # These identifiers are always controlled by library code, never user input.
    # Inline # nosec B608 annotations are also present on each affected line.
